# Log of my weekly plans and goals 
### May 31st - June 3rd
Tuesday and Wednesday had the same schedule. Had orientation in the morning, followed by group zoom sessions. I attended the TRACER meetings
at 1pm. After that, I focused on completing any TMS training that I still had to do. Thursday morning I finished the last training besides the JHQ which is waiting
approval. On Friday, I came in person and worked on downloading packages like pyart and goes2go. Read up on pyart and started working on satelite and trying to zoom in
over Houston. No good so far and will try more Monday. 
### June 6th - June 10th
Monday I started the week by doing tutorials for sounding data as well as working with metpy. Later in the day, I started to work with sounding data from ARM and troublingshooting sounding graphs. Tuesday, I finished most of my sounding code and fixed problems with wind bars and missing graph lines. I still want to add more to the code but limited by having to manually import files. Waiting for ARM Webservice to be functional again. Wednesday, spent the morning preparing for the TRACER forecast where I co-forecasted the vertification section with Maggie. After the TRACER meeting, I went back to working with sounding data from the La Porte site (I think). I waiting on the repo to be sent to me so I can move forward with the project.
