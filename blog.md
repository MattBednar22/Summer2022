# Log of my weekly plans and goals 
### May 31st - June 3rd
Tuesday and Wednesday had the same schedule. Had orientation in the morning, followed by group zoom sessions. I attended the TRACER meetings
at 1pm. After that, I focused on completing any TMS training that I still had to do. Thursday morning I finished the last training besides the JHQ which is waiting
approval. On Friday, I came in person and worked on downloading packages like pyart and goes2go. Read up on pyart and started working on satelite and trying to zoom in
over Houston. No good so far and will try more Monday.
